# Glassdoor Company Scraper

This custom Alteryx tool scrapes reviews and interviews from Glassdoor.com.

### Basic installation

Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Alteryx-Python/AlteryxTools/releases) page.  The zip file contains a YXI installer and a sample workflow.  Extract the contents of the zip file.

Double-click on the YXI installer to install the Glassdoor company scraper.  Alteryx will attempt to install the tool with a virtual environment.  In many cases this should be sufficient.

### If the basic installation does not succeed

If the basic install fails, close Alteryx.  Then run Alteryx as an administrator by right-clicking on the shortcut and selecting 'Run as administrator'.  From within Alteryx, open the YXI file and select the option to install for all users.
